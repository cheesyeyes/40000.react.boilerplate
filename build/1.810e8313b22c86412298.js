    'As a metaphor, jungle often refers to situations that are unruly or lawless, or where the only law is perceived to be \u201Csurvival of the fittest\u201D. This reflects the view of \u201Ccity people\u201D that forests are such places. Upton Sinclair gave the title The Jungle (1906) to his famous book about the life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards portraying the workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or other lawful recourse. The term "The Law of the Jungle" is also used in a similar context, drawn from Rudyard Kipling\u2019s The Jungle Book (1894) \u2014 though in the society of jungle animals portrayed in that book and obviously meant as a metaphor for human society, that phrase referred to an intricate code of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to a lawless chaos. The word \u201Cjungle\u201D itself carries connotations of untamed and uncontrollable nature and isolation from civilisation, along with the emotions that evokes: threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation and immobilisation. The change from \u201Cjungle\u201D to \u201Crainforest\u201D as the preferred term for describing tropical forests as has been a response to an increasing perception of these forests as fragile and spiritual places, a viewpoint not in keeping with the darker connotations of \u201Cjungle\u201D.'
