# React Boilerplates (How To Cook In The Jungle :palm_tree: :see_no_evil:)

Recently the react ecoysystem seems to turn into a complex jungle.
If you're not a full stack developer this makes it complicated to get into it.
This is a try to keep super reduced boilerplates in one place! :tada:

# :open_book: Choose your favourite plate from the jungle:

### :banana: [0.1. React](../../tree/0.1)
```script
git clone https://github.com/cheesyeyes/40000.react.boilerplate.git -b 0.1.
```

Next: Write in ES6[BABEL].

### :avocado: [1.   React, Webpack - (ES6:Babel)](../../tree/1)
```script
git clone https://github.com/cheesyeyes/40000.react.boilerplate.git -b 1 . && npm install && npm run build && npm run start
```

Next: Write in ES6, Browser refreshes automatically[HMR].

### :pineapple: [2. React, Webpack(webpack-dev-server[HMR:CLI]) - (ES6:Babel)](../../tree/2)

```script
git clone https://github.com/cheesyeyes/40000.react.boilerplate.git -b 3 . && npm install && npm run start
```

Next: Write in ES6, Changes will we displayed immediately(Browser doesn't even need to refresh)[HMR+HOT LOADING]

### 3.1. React, Webpack[HMR](webpack-dev-server API) - (ES6:Babel)
### 3.2. React, Webpack[HMR](custom server MIDDLEWARE) - (ES6:Babel)

### Scripts
Each plate provides the following scripts:

```script
npm run build
npm run start
npm run start:develoment
npm run start:production
```
