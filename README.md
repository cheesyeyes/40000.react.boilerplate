## Architecture

### We do always have two sides: The 'source' and 'build'.

The source is where we work. This is where we cook, these are our raw ingredients.
```script
source/
```

The build is the final product that we serve. We never work in here.
Meaning: Do never every edit anything in here manually.
```script
build/
```

Other may follow these convention by naming the directories 'src', 'dist' etc. Since where is a complex and growing jungle :palm_tree:
, it might be a good idea to just write things out.

### We do also always have at least the two scripts:

```
npm run build // 'Builds' Packs our Javascript code into one file.
npm start //Opens our built project
```
