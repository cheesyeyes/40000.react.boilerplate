# React Boilerplates (How To Cook In The Jungle :palm_tree: :see_no_evil:)

Recently the react ecoysystem seems to turn into a complex jungle.
If you're not a full stack developer this makes it complicated to get into it.
This is a try to keep super reduced boilerplates in one place! :tada:

# :open_book: Choose your favourite plate from the jungle:

### :banana: [0.1. React](../../tree/0.1)
```script
git clone https://github.com/cheesyeyes/40000.react.boilerplate.git -b 0.1.
```

### :avocado: [1.   React, Webpack - (ES6:Babel)](../../tree/1)
```script
git clone https://github.com/cheesyeyes/40000.react.boilerplate.git -b 1 . && npm install && npm run build && npm run start
```
