# The React Junglebook :see_no_evil: :palm_tree:

### (The Most Simple Boilerplates For The React Jungle)

Recently the react ecoysystem seems to turn into a complex jungle.

If you're not a full stack developer this makes it complicated to get into it.

Here are the most reduced boilerplates as possible. :tada:

Keep the web accessible!

# Plates:

Each Plate has its own branch.

(Clone directly from the command line or select the specific branch.)

### Scripts
Each plate comes with the same script scheme:

```script
npm run clean

npm develop:cli
npm develop:api
npm develop

npm run build
npm run start

```
