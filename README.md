# React Boilerplates (How To Cook In The Jungle)

## 1. React, Webpack - (ES6:Babel)

How to cook the most basic modern meal.

### From now on we have two sides: The directories 'source' and 'built'.

The source is where we work. This is where we cook, these are our raw ingredients.
```script
source/
```

The build is what we server. We never work in here. 
Meaning: Do never every edit anything in here manually. 
```script
built/
```

Other may follow these convention by naming the directories 'src', 'dist' etc. Since where is a complex and growing jungle :palm_tree:
, it might be a good idea to just write things out.
